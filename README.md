# QuantumCircuitSimulator

## Overview
Welcome to the Quantum Circuit Simulator, a Python-based tool for building and simulating quantum circuits. This simulator empowers you to explore the fascinating world of quantum computing by creating and applying quantum circuits to qubits. Whether you're a quantum enthusiast, researcher, or developer, this simulator offers a versatile environment for quantum circuit experimentation.

### Key Features

- **Quantum Circuit Construction**: Easily design and assemble quantum circuits by adding various quantum gates, controlling qubits, and arranging gates in a sequence.

- **Multiple Qubit Support**: Create quantum circuits with one or two qubits and experiment with quantum operations on qubit states.

- **Measurement and Visualization**: Measure qubit states and visualize measurement results, helping you understand the probabilistic nature of quantum systems.

- **QuantumCircuitRunner**: Run quantum circuits multiple times and view measurement outcomes as normalized histograms. Analyze the behavior of quantum circuits and gain insights into measurement probabilities.
